                    An activist. <br><br>
                    An environmentalist.<br><br>
                    A leader. <br><br>

            <p class="intro-p">  
                Born in Megania, Jones grew up close to the lands of one of Franchonia's remaining native tribes. 
                While in Megania's Lincoln University, Deidre Jones led environmental activist groups that sought to minimize the destruction of Megania's forests. 
                And when Jan Goodet, one of Franchonia's leading environmentalists, came to visit their campus, Jones introduced her with a 
                speech so powerful that Goodet offered her a job as one of her personal aides. <br><br>
                While Jones didn't accept the offer, she continued to correspond with Goodet while Jones went to graduate school for ecology. 
                After graduating with her Master's degree, Jones began working as an environmental lobbyist; however, she was dissatisfied 
                with the slow rate of change within the government and quit lobbying, instead writing a successful book called "The Way Things Are and Should Be", 
                which propelled her into the national spotlight. <br><br>
                However, many business leaders saw her as an obstacle, given how she was arrested at a protest in Jesshire while simply giving a speech 
                about the state's low standard for pollution. Luckily, the charges were later dropped due to the negative reaction of the public towards Jones' arrest. <br><br>
                A year later, Jones announced that she would run for president.<br><br>
                Despite the backlash from many, including Breckenridge himself, Jones didn't back down, which has brought her to now, 
                as one of the three candidates for president of Franchonia.
