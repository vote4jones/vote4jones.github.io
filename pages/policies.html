                    <b>Military Funding</b><br>
                    With the high funding the military has received for many years, our military is very strong and has great technology and resources at hand. 
                    However, even with this strong military, the Breckenridge administration continues to pour significant funds into the military for new updates and advancements. 
                    These extra projects are completely unnecessary, especially considering there are many other more significant issues in Franchonia. 
                    The Jones campaign will provide funding needed only to maintain a stable and strong military, but we will reallocate the excess of funds currently spent on non essential military projects towards our new plans for the environment, education, healthcare, and government subsidized employment programs.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Income Taxes</b><br>
                    We will maintain a progressive income tax, but will increase the tax rates for higher income earners while maintaining a lower tax rate for poorer and middle class citizens.<br><br>
                    We will increase the income taxes for people in the top 3 income brackets.

                    <br><br>
                    <b>Corporate Taxes and Small businesses</b><br>
                    We will raise the corporate taxes for large corporations and businesses from 21% to 35% on the profits of corporations. 
                    If this seems like a lot, it has actually been like this for a while, as only 4 years ago, Breckenridge changed the rate from 35% to 21%, favoring big businesses and giving unneeded tax breaks. Before Breckenridge did this, the corporate tax had been 35% for over 20 years, and even higher previously, while still maintaining success for both large and small businesses. 
                    Small businesses are not under the same tax criteria as large corporations, and are taxed on a progressive profit scale similar to income taxes. On average, they face a tax rate of 20%, but the rate can be down to 10% for the smallest businesses.<br><br>

                    <b>Employment plans which will help poor</b><br>
                    <!-- https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/promising-policies-could-reduce-economic-hardship-expand<br> -->
                    We want to work towards full employment - this is when virtually everyone who wants to work can find a job. 
                    When demand for labor is high and unemployment is low, employers compete for workers by offering work with higher wages and better working conditions. This is especially true for low-wage workers who tend to see their real wages grow more when the labor market is very tight. 
                    Therefore, economic policies promoting full employment are important especially for low income workers.<br>
                    One of the policies that we plan to implement that can lead towards full employment is <b>government subsidized employment programs</b>. 
                    These programs offer job seekers a government-funded, temporary paid job that helps them meet their basic needs, learn basic work skills, and gain meaningful work experience. 
                    In some cases, job seekers receive supportive services that can improve the chances of long-term employment success such as child care, on-the-job training, job search services, and intensive case management or coaching. 
                    Our economists have shown that subsidized employment significantly increases wages and employment in the short term, helping those in poverty immediately. 
                    <b>It is not aid, it is an investment. </b>
                    These jobs are also beneficial to Franchonia, and can be used for many things depending on the situation of the country. For example, helping conduct and run relief efforts for natural disasters, which we will do for the hurricane destructions in Polamalia and Mikon. 
                    We can also use these jobs to support infrastructure and urban development, although private businesses are more apt to handle this.<br><br>


                    <b>Urban Development and infrastructure</b><br>
                    The private sector is a key stakeholder in both urban and economic development, being a major contributor to national income and the principal job creator and employer. 
                    The private sector provides around 90% of employment in the developing world, delivers critical goods and services and contributes to tax revenues and the efficient flow of capital. Further, it will undertake the majority of future development in urban areas. 
                    <b>Municipalities (local administrations in cities) can strengthen urban governance</b> in cooperation with the private sector by fostering partnerships and local economic development (LED) strategies that combine local skills, resources and ideas to stimulate the local economy, enabling it to respond innovatively to national and global economic changes. For example, effective LED strategies detail how the municipality will: <br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Develop and maintain infrastructure and services;<br></li>
                    <li>Promote human capital development, to help vulnerable groups especially to participate in the labour market;<br></li>
                    <li>Encourage community development by promoting community business and co-operatives, local exchange systems and informal credit etc.;<br></li>
                    <li>Promote small, micro and medium enterprises (SMME) through supply-side measures (training, provision of space and facilities for commercial activity etc.) and demand-side measures (reforms to procurement policy to ensure access for SMMEs to contracts);<br></li>
                    <li>Attract investment in the city;<br></li>
                    </ul>
                    In fostering partnerships, municipalities need to build relations with local and foreign private sector interests by involving associations and companies in city-wide strategic planning processes. <br><br>

                    <b>Trade Policy - Tariffs on foriegn imports and export taxes</b><br>
                    While everyone knows we want to expand foreign relations and foreign trade, we still want to maintain a trade surplus, not a trade deficit, in Franchonia, by exporting more goods than we import. 
                    A trade surplus contributes to economic growth in a country. When there are more exports, it means that there is a high level of output from a country's factories and industrial facilities, as well as a greater number of people that are being employed in order to keep these factories in operation. 
                    When a company is exporting a high level of goods, this also equates to a flow of funds into the country, which stimulates consumer spending and contributes to economic growth.<br><br>

                    <b>Tariffs on imports</b><br>
                    With Franchoniaâ€™s great supply of natural resources and well-developed manufacturing industry, there is not an extremely pressing need for many imported goods. This is important in creating a trade surplus and greater economic growth. 
                    However, imports can still be important in emergencies and natural disasters, for relief, like in the recent hurricanes or drought. 
                    We will lower tariffs on foreign imports to a level that allows other countries to have a reason to trade with us (we may need a specific price, but -  tariffs will be on average about 4%). 
                    In industries where Franchonia is more developed, like automobiles and agriculture, we want to maintain relatively high tariffs (they will still be decreased from the current rates), reducing competition and keeping domestic manufacturers as the main source of production. 
                    However, importing productive assets like machinery and equipment are favorable for a country since these assets will improve the economy's productivity over the long run. 
                    We will reduce tariffs significantly on materials, parts, and other natural resources as so to not exhaust our own resources, as well as to improve economic efficiency for businesses. 
                    Foreign trade allows us to trade for goods and services which may be costly to develop in our own nation. 
                    For example, Phillipsburg has tried to develop industrial complexes to spark a slower economy, but this has polluted the environment and water supply. 
                    We can outsource some of this industrial manufacturing that is harmful to our people, and use those imported goods to expedite our own innovations and businesses, fostering more efficient economic growth. 
                    Through this process, productivity increases as more resources flow to the economic activities in which our country focuses on. 
                    Tariffs can raise the cost of intermediate goods such as parts and materials, which then raises the price of goods that use those inputs and reduces private sector output. 
                    This would result in lower incomes for both workers and the owners of capital. Similarly, higher consumer prices due to tariffs would reduce real wages, as cost of living would increase. 
                    History and our economists have shown that tariffs fail to achieve their intended objectives, and result in higher prices, lower employment, and slower economic growth in the long run.<br><br>

                    <b>Export taxes</b><br>
                    While we will lower export taxes, they will still be higher than taxes on domestic sales, ensuring that the Franchonian peopleâ€™s needs are met first and foremost. 
                    We want to lower export taxes for basically all products, except lumber and oil. 
                    Too much deforestation and oil drilling is bad for the environment and we will not encourage further deforestation and drilling. 
                    We will especially support the great farmers in Lambert and Sharmington who can make a more stable standard of living. When they have surpluses, they can make a significant increase in income by selling food to foreign markets, and this would hold them over in times like the current drought. <br>

                <p><b>Environmental Plans</b><br><br>

                    We will implement green tech, create new jobs for white collar citizens, which helps the working class, and the working class will buy the new tech which stimulates the economy. <br><br>
                    
                    We will implement reforms to prevent climate change, such as:<br>
                    Regulating corporations and manufacturers to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency;<br>
                    Setting limits and standards for the amount of emissions a company can have - the specific limit depends on size of company/amount of production they do;<br>
                    Provide government subsidies (financial support) to companies working on green energy, environmentally beneficial innovations;<br><br>
                    
                    Shifting away from greenhouse gasses and fossil fuels that pollute our air everyday and turning towards renewable energy sources is another important step we would like to take.<br>
                    In order to do so, we would like to introduce incentive based policies, such as: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Providing money when companies are below certain standards of pollution - therefore they make money by polluting less and finding new innovations;<br></li>
                        <li> Providing incentives (discounts) for consumers when they buy environmentally friendly products, like solar panels, electric cars;<br></li>
                        <li>Addding a carbon tax of $40 per metric ton of carbon produced;<br><br></li>
                    </ul>
                    In this way, we will be able to encourage more environmentally friendly methods of production.<br><br>

                    <b>Hurricane and Natural Disaster Relief Policies</b><br>
                    Government subsidized employment programs (view economic plans for more detail)<br><br>
                    
                    
                    <b>Welfare Programs for Poverty</b><br>
                    We will add welare programs in order to aid those in poverty and/or struggling with keeping afloat. However, we want
                    to only add a few programs in order to reduce complexity, as well as keep the programs consistent with each other to make
                    it easier for citizens to use them.<br>
                    In addition, we will create the programs such that those in extreme poverty are not left out, since they are the most
                    likely to be unable to navigate welfare programs. In addition, we will address alcohol and drug addictions that afflict 
                    citizens.<br>
                    The welfare programs will be balanced such that they will gain benefits proportional to their income while encouraging
                    work. For example, a family making $15,000 a year will gain more benefits than a family making $35,000 a year; however, 
                    we will balance the benefits so that both families will be encouraged to work. 
                    
                    
                    
                    <b>Healthcare</b><br>
                    We do not support full universal healthcare, but this plan consists of making it cheaper and more accessible for the poor. <br>
                    We want to be more preventative and ensure good health, diet and fitness for everyone from a young age. <br>
                    We donâ€™t want to be like the US - The health care system in the United States is uncoordinated and fragmented and emphasizes intervention rather than prevention and comprehensive health management. Health care costs continue to increase at an unsustainable rate and quality is far from ideal. <br>
                    We will make primary care more accessible and emphasize its importance - primary care is basic day to day healthcare for everyone, providing a basis health level. <br>
                    Studies confirm that if primary care practices redesign how they operate so that they are more accessible, promote prevention, proactively support patients who have chronic illnesses, and engage patients in self-management and decision-making, health care quality improves along with the cost efficiency of care. <br><br>
                    
                    
                    <b>Education</b><br>
                    We will improve Franchoniaâ€™s education system and make funding for schools a priority. We intend to reduce the cost of education to make it accessible to everyone and provide improved resources for teachers and students, through changes such as: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Free breakfast and lunch for poor students (below certain income level) to encourage them to go to school; <br></li>
                        <li>Provide programs which expose students to potential career paths, including technical training; <br></li>
                        <li>We will focus on having excellent teachers through assistance, support and leadership programs; <br></li>
                        <li>Better teachers - kids will learn better values, not only in school, but in life and positive mindsets; <br></li>
                        <li>Kids will learn by example, and will learn how to be kind, compassionate, and assertive for what they want; <br></li>
                        <li>More balanced curriculum - Will teach not only school skills, but other life skills like social skills, leadership, speaking skills, critical thinking that can be applied everywhere;<br><br></li>
                    </ul>

                    <b>Foreign Diplomacy</b><br>
                    We want to create and maintain mutually beneficial, respectful, and positive relationships with our neighboring nations.<br>
                    
                    To create these relationships, we will:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trade openly with other nations, supporting them while they support our economy, creating balanced trade relationships and positive connections with other countries;<br></li>
                        <li>Be peaceful and courteous diplomatically - While Franchoniaâ€™s own goals always come first, we support human rights and equality and will support these principles worldwide;<br><br></li>                
                    </ul>
                    
                    Of course, while we will maintain positive relationships with other countries, Franchonian people are always the first priority and their needs will be taken care of before anything else. This being said, positive diplomatic relationships will only benefit the people of Franchonia by growing our economy and creating allies for times of emergency.<br><br>
                    
                    
                    <b>Other Important Policies</b><br>
                    We do not support the death penalty and plan to abolish it.<br>
                    We support workerâ€™s rights, including those to unionize and to peacefully protest.<br>
